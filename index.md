# About me

Welcome to my homepage! I am Weihang Su (苏炜航), a second-year PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. Yiqun Liu. 

My research focuses on leveraging AI technology to better meet user's information needs, specifically in the following areas:

- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Complex IR Tasks
- AI for Legal Applications

I am also passionate about mentoring undergraduate students in research. I've collaborated with undergraduate students like Changyue Wang, Yichen Tang, and Anzhe Xie, co-authoring high-quality papers at top-tier conferences such as ACL. 

Suppose you are an undergraduate interested in my research areas and aiming to publish high-quality papers. In that case, you can apply for an internship with the THUIR group through official channels or contact me directly to embark on meaningful research together!
