# About me

My name is Weihang Su (苏炜航, in Chinese). I am now a first year PhD student at Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University. My supervisor is Prof. Yiqun Liu.
My research lies in Information Retrieval, Web Search, and Brain Machine Interface (BMI). I currently focus on Pre-trained Language Models for IR.
